# **Lens Assembly Guide**

*This document explains how to make the lens for the current version of the Glia Otoscope.*

You will need the following:
         
        3D Printed Parts:
        ◦ Lens holder (large)
        ◦ Lens holder (small)
        ◦ Lens jig
        
        Other:
        ◦ Lens, 3x magnification 
        ◦ Masking tape
        ◦ Pen or fine marker
        ◦ Saw
        ◦ Sander

**Step 1**

Cover back and front of lens with masking tape to protect it.

**Step 2**

Place lens jig over lens. Use pen or fine marker to trace shape onto lens, as close to lens jig as possible. Then take lens jig off of lens.

**Step 3**

Carefully use saw to roughly cut out traced shape just outside of traced line. In this video, a band saw is being used.

**Step 4**

Carefully use sander to refine cut out lens so that it will fit snugly into large lens holder. It is recommended to go slow, and try the fit after each time you sand to make sure you get a snug fit and don’t sand the lens too small. Sand the lens to get as close to the traced line as possible.

There should not be any gaps between the lens and the large lens holder.

**Step 5**

Once the lens fits snugly into the large lens holder, carefully take off the masking tape without touching the face of the lens, and push it all the way into the large lens holder. Then push the small lens holder in to secure the lens in the holder.

The fit should be snug enough that you do not need to secure the lens in the holder with glue.
