## AA battery case

## 5mm LED light
#### Really, any 5mm bright white LED could be used.  I like the one listed below because it is much brighter than any other LED light I've used.  Check the voltages of the LED you use, if the LED is rated for less that 3.2V, reassess which resistor you put into the circuit.

## 3x magnification lens
#### Below are two links to lenses that would work with the otoscope.  Following the [Lens Assembly Guide](https://github.com/GliaX/Otoscope/blob/master/docs/LENS_ASSEMBLY.md), you should manipulate the lens to fit in the holder. The Amazon listing below is the lens that fits the [new_lensjig2024.stl](https://github.com/GliaX/Otoscope/blob/master/lens_jig/new_lensjig2024.stl) part.  I recommend also checking local department stores for these items too. They can go by the name of "pocket reader", "3x magnifier with LED", and "Easy reader".  

* Ebay Listing for a pocket reader, listing titled "A Credit Card LED Magnifier Loupe with Light Case Magnifying Glass Utility [[Ebay](https://www.ebay.com/p/Credit-Card-LED-Magnifier-Loupe-With-Light-Leather-Case-Magnifying-Glass-Utility/3029465108?iid=362601347786&rt=nc) $2.39]
