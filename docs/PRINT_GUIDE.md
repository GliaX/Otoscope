# Print Guide

This document explains how to orient and print the various printed parts. This guide uses [Slic3r](http://slic3r.org/)

## Print settings

All parts (other than the handle) should be printed with an infill of 100% and layer height of 0.2mm.  

*The handle should be printed with an infil of 20%.*

A couple of tips when printing in Petg:
<br>
If you have trouble getting the battery_holder and handle to fit properly, print the handle at 2% larger, and the battery_holder at 1% smaller (the wired battery case should still fit when the bottom edges are trimmed). If you have trouble getting the neck_led_holder to fit the button cover, print it at 2% smaller (and then print the neck_cover_plate at 2% smaller as well so that it will fit the led holder).

## Supports

The following parts can be printed without any supports from the 3mf file uploaded:
  * Handle
  * Label plate
  * Lens large
  * Lens small
  * Neck cover plate
  * Neck led holder
  * Plate pins
  * Button cover
  
The following should be printed with supports:
  * Battery holder (full supports)
  * Head (supports on build plate only)

## Orientation
Orient the parts as in the build plate below:
