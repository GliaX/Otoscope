# Print Guide

This document explains how to orient and print the various printed parts. This guide uses [Slic3r](http://slic3r.org/)

## Print settings

All parts (other than the handle) should be printed with an infill of 100% and layer height of 0.2mm.  The handle should be printed with an infil of 20%.
When printing in Petg, if you have trouble getting the handle to fit, print the handle at 2% larger, and if you have trouble getting the neck_led_holder, print it at 2% smaller.

  * Battery holder
  * Handle
  * Label plate
